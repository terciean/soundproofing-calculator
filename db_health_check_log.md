# Database Health Check Log

## Solution and Pro Variant Storage Verification

### Ceilings
- **genieclipceiling.py**
  - Contains `GenieClipCeilingStandard` and `GenieClipCeilingSP15` classes.
  - Each variant has its own calculation and implementation logic.
  - `surface_type` is set to "ceiling" and included in the result dict.
  - SP15 (pro) variant inserts SP15 Soundboard into materials and has its own methods for characteristics and acoustic properties.
  - Caching and logging are handled per variant.

- **independentceiling.py**
  - Contains `IndependentCeilingStandard` and `IndependentCeilingSP15` classes.
  - Each variant has its own calculation and characteristics logic.
  - SP15 (pro) variant updates result with SP15-specific info and logs cache status.
  - Caching is handled per variant, and characteristics are copied to avoid modifying cached data.

### Walls
- **GenieClipWall.py**
  - Contains `GenieClipWallStandard` and `GenieClipWallSP15` classes.
  - Each variant has its own calculation and implementation logic.
  - `surface_type` is set to "wall" and included in the result dict.
  - SP15 (pro) variant inserts SP15 Soundboard into materials and updates installation steps.
  - Caching and logging are handled per variant.

- **Independentwall.py**
  - Contains `IndependentWallStandard` and `IndependentWallSP15` classes.
  - Each variant has its own calculation and characteristics logic.
  - SP15 (pro) variant updates result with SP15-specific info and logs cache status.
  - Caching is handled per variant, and characteristics are copied to avoid modifying cached data.

### Summary
- Each solution and its "pro" (SP15) variant are implemented as separate classes in their respective calculation files for ceilings and walls.
- Both standard and pro variants have their own calculation, caching, and logging logic.
- `surface_type` segmentation is handled in the result dict and not at the storage level, matching the requirement that segmentation only occurs during caching.
- No issues found with the separation or storage of standard and pro variants for ceilings and walls.

*This log will be updated as further findings arise.*


## [Update] Material-to-Solutions Mapping Cache

- Implemented a method in `SoundproofingSolutions` to build and cache a mapping from each material (from the universal materials list in MongoDB) to all solutions that use it.
- The recommendation engine now updates this mapping cache every time materials are loaded and validated, ensuring the mapping is always in sync with the latest database state.
- The mapping is stored in the cache manager under the key `material_to_solutions` with a 24-hour TTL.
- This guarantees that the recommendation system dynamically links materials to their respective solutions, with no hardcoded data.


## [Ceilings & Walls] Material-to-Solution Mapping Health Check

- Verified that the material-to-solution mapping and caching logic in `SoundproofingSolutions` applies to all registered solutions, including ceilings and walls.
- All ceiling and wall solution classes register their materials via the `get_characteristics` method, which is used by the mapping logic.
- The mapping is automatically updated and cached for all solution types, ensuring retry and continue workflows are supported without manual intervention.
- No issues found with dynamic mapping or cache refresh for ceilings and walls.
