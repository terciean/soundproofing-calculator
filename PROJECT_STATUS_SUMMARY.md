# Project Status Summary: Frontend Reconstruction

## Date: July 7, 2025

## Objective
To reconstruct the JavaScript frontend of the Soundproofing Calculator application in a modularized way, following the provided file outline and suggested structure, without deleting any existing files.

## Current Situation
The JavaScript frontend was previously corrupted/deleted. The goal is to rebuild it based on outdated markdown files and general knowledge of the application's functionality. The backend (Python/Flask) and MongoDB database are assumed to be functional.

## Progress Made

### Directory Structure
Confirmed and/or created the following modular directory structure under `C:\Users\unkno\soundproof\soundproofing-calculator\static\js`:
- `calculators`
- `core`
- `error`
- `error-logging`
- `form-logging`
- `forms`
- `handlers`
- `managers`
- `modules`
- `processors`
- `recommendations`
- `services`
- `solutions`
- `surfaces`
- `testing`
- `utils`

### Files Created and Their Functionality

1.  **`static/js/services/base-service.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Foundational module for client-side communication.

    -   **Purpose:** Processes raw noise data from the frontend.
    -   **Functionality:** Validates input noise data (type, intensity 0-10), transforms it into a structured format (`{ type, intensity, direction, frequency }`) expected by the backend.

5.  **`static/js/managers/recommendation-display-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Renders soundproofing recommendations in the UI.

    -   **Purpose:** Displays cost estimates in the UI.
    -   **Functionality:** `displayCosts` method to show total cost and a detailed breakdown (materials, labor, etc.).

7.  **`static/js/managers/display-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages broader UI updates and general display logic.
    -   **Functionality:** Methods for `showSection`, `hideSection`, `showLoadingIndicator`, `hideLoadingIndicator`, `showMessage`, `clearMessage`, and `updateNavigationState`.

8.  **`static/js/managers/surface-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages high-level operations related to surfaces (walls, ceilings, floors, blockages).
    -   **Functionality:** Methods for `addBlockage`, `removeBlockage`, `updateWallType`, `updateWallFeature`, `updateSurfaceProperty`, and `_recalculateBlockageSummary` (calling backend).

9.  **`static/js/surfaces/surface-controller.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Handles UI interactions related to surfaces.
    -   **Functionality:** Initializes event listeners for adding blockages and changing wall types, and interacts with `SurfaceManager`.

10. **`static/js/utils/form-state.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages the current state of the form (singleton).
    -   **Functionality:** Methods to `updateCurrentSection`, `markSectionComplete`, `isSectionComplete`, `getState`, and `resetState`.

11. **`static/js/utils/initialize.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Performs initial application setup and configurations.
    -   **Functionality:** `initializeApp` function for initial DOM manipulations, loading initial data (e.g., from local storage), and setting up global event listeners.

12. **`static/js/utils/theme-toggle.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages theme toggling (e.g., light/dark mode).
    -   **Functionality:** Initializes theme based on local storage or system preference, and provides `toggleTheme` and `setTheme` methods.

13. **`static/js/utils/dimensions-input.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Retrieves and validates room dimension inputs.
    -   **Functionality:** `getDimensions` method to parse and validate length, width, and height from input fields.

14. **`static/js/solutions/solution-profiles.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages and renders predefined soundproofing solution profiles.
    -   **Functionality:** `getAllProfiles`, `getProfileById`, and `renderProfiles` methods.

15. **`static/js/recommendations/base-recommendation.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Defines a base structure for soundproofing recommendations.
    -   **Functionality:** Provides a constructor for common recommendation properties and utility methods like `toObject`, `getSummary`, `filter`, and `sort`.

16. **`static/js/managers/container-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages the dynamic display and state of UI containers.
    -   **Functionality:** Methods to `showContainer`, `hideContainer`, `toggleContainer`, `loadContent`, `setContainerState`, and `getContainerState`.

17. **`static/js/managers/dependency-manager.js`**

    -   **Purpose:** Manages the input and validation of noise direction data.
    -   **Functionality:** `getDirections`, `setDirections`, and `isValidDirection` methods for UI elements.

19. **`static/js/managers/event-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Provides a centralized, singleton event bus for custom events.
    -   **Functionality:** `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `publish`, and `clearListeners` methods.

20. **`static/js/handlers/recommendation-handler.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Orchestrates the process of fetching and displaying recommendations.
    -   **Functionality:** `generateAndDisplayRecommendations` method that calls `endpoint-service` and `recommendation-display-manager`, with placeholders for pre/post-processing.

21. **`static/js/managers/recommendation-manager.js`**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages the overall recommendation process, strategies, and history.
    -   **Functionality:** `getRecommendations` (using `RecommendationHandler`), `setStrategy`, `getHistory`, `_addToHistory`, and `clearHistory`.

### Integrations
-   `main.js` has been updated to initialize `FormHandlers`, `SurfaceController`, `initializeApp`, `ThemeToggle`, and `SolutionProfiles`.
-   `form-handlers-module.js` has been updated to import and utilize `EndpointService`, `RecommendationDisplayManager`, `CostHandler`, `DisplayManager`, `NoiseProfileProcessor`, `SurfaceManager`, `FormStateManager`, and `DimensionsInput`.

## Next Steps
Continue creating the remaining files from the provided outline, integrating them into the existing structure as appropriate. Focus on implementing the core functionality for each module as discussed.
