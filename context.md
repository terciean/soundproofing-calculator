Project Overview
The Soundproofing Calculator is a full-stack web application designed to calculate soundproofing solutions based on room dimensions, noise profiles, and surface characteristics. It provides recommendations and cost estimates for soundproofing treatments, leveraging a Python/Flask backend, a JavaScript frontend, and a MongoDB database.

Purpose: Assist users in selecting cost-effective soundproofing solutions tailored to their specific needs.

High-Level Structure Overview
The system is a full-stack application with distinct frontend and backend components, integrated through RESTful API endpoints.

Backend (Python/Flask)
Core File: app.py (54,391 bytes, 31 functions) serves as the Flask application entry point, defining API endpoints that connect frontend requests to backend logic.
Supporting Modules: Files like solutions.py, cost_calculator.py, and recommendation_engine.py handle business logic, calculations, and database interactions.
Database: MongoDB, accessed via db_init.py and database.py, stores collections such as wallsolutions, ceilingsolutions, floorsolutions, noise_profiles, and materials.
Frontend (JavaScript)
Key Files: 35 files, including endpoint-service.js, form-handlers.js, and recommendation-display-manager.js, manage user input, API calls, and result rendering.
Stats: 651,093 bytes, 295 functions (including 47 standalone in form-handlers.js), 30 classes, 11,997 lines of code.
Data Flow
User Input: Frontend collects data (e.g., room dimensions, noise type) via forms.
API Request: JavaScript sends HTTP requests to app.py endpoints (e.g., /api/recommendations).
Backend Processing: app.py delegates to supporting modules, retrieves data from MongoDB, performs calculations, and generates responses.
UI Update: Frontend receives JSON responses and updates the DOM with recommendations, costs, and details.
Core Components
1. Backend (Python/Flask)
app.py - Central Hub
Role: Defines API endpoints, orchestrates requests, and returns responses.
Key Endpoints:
/api/solutions/<surface_type>: Fetches solutions by surface type.
/api/calculate-costs: Unified cost calculations.
/api/recommendations: Generates soundproofing recommendations.
/api/process-inputs: Validates and processes user inputs.
/api/calculate_blockage_summary: Summarizes blockage areas.
Imports: Integrates solutions.py, cost_calculator.py, recommendation_engine.py, etc.
Supporting Modules
Database Access (db_init.py, database.py)
Functions: get_client(), get_db(), get_collection(), get_solution_id_from_display_name().
Notes: Uses connection pooling, reads-only from MongoDB, falls back gracefully if collections are unavailable.
Solutions Manager (solutions.py)
Functions: get_solutions_manager(), get_solutions_by_type(), get_solution_class().
Notes: Manages solution types, provides fallback data.
Cost Calculator (cost_calculator.py)
Functions: calculate_solution_costs(), calculate_material_cost().
Notes: Uses material data from MongoDB.
Acoustic Calculator (acoustic_calculator.py)
Functions: get_acoustic_calculator(), _get_material_properties(), estimate_stc_rating().
Notes: Calculates acoustic properties (e.g., STC ratings).
Solution Calculator (solution_calculator.py)
Functions: get_solution_calculator(), generate_implementation_details().
Notes: Generates solution-specific details.
Blockage Calculator (blockage_calculator.py)
Functions: calculate_blockage_summary().
Notes: Handles blockage area calculations.
Recommendation Engine (recommendation_engine.py)
Functions: get_recommendations(), rank_solutions(), get_noise_type_reasoning().
Notes: Ranks solutions based on noise profiles and room data.
Solution-Specific Files (e.g., GenieClipWall.py)
Role: Define classes with calculate() and get_characteristics() methods for specific solutions.
Glue Components
Solution Mapping (solution_mapping.py): Maps solution names to classes/database entries.
Logging (logger.py): Provides debugging logs.
Constants (solution_constants.py): Defines shared data (e.g., SOLUTION_MAPPINGS).
2. Frontend (JavaScript)
