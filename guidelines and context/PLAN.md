# Plan: Aligning Chunk Files with JavaScript Code

## Objective
Ensure each chunk file accurately represents the corresponding JavaScript code, and document integration points with the backend.

## Steps
1. **Inventory JavaScript Files**
   - List all JS files in the project (especially in `static/js/` and related frontend directories).
2. **Inventory Chunk Files**
   - List all chunk documentation files (e.g., `chunk 1 util and core js.txt`, `chunk 1 testing and tools.txt`).
3. **Mapping**
   - Map each JS file to its corresponding chunk file.
   - Identify any JS files not represented in a chunk file and vice versa.
4. **Review and Update**
   - For each chunk file:
     - Ensure summaries and file lists match the actual code.
     - Update or create chunk files as needed for accuracy.
5. **Backend Communication Points**
   - Note any JS files that interact with backend endpoints (e.g., API calls, fetch requests).
   - Document these integration points in the summary.
6. **Summary Documentation**
   - Create a summary file mapping chunk files to JS files and highlighting backend integration.

## Deliverables
- Updated chunk files accurately reflecting code.
- A summary file documenting the mapping and backend communication points.
