1. Simplify the Backend
Your backend has a bunch of files doing similar things, which is confusing and hard to maintain. Let's merge some of them and clarify their roles.

What's Messy
Too Many Static Data Files: You've got constants.py, solution_constants.py, and solution_profiles.py all handling noise profiles, solution catalogs, and mappings. It's overkill.
Mapping Files Overlap: solution_mapping.py and solution_mapping_new.py are both trying to map frontend to backend, but solution_mapping_new.py is the better one with MongoDB integration.
Calculator Files Are Scattered: Logic for solution calculations is split across base_calculator.py, solution_calculator.py, and specific solution files like genieclipceiling.py.
How to Fix It
Merge Static Data:
Do This: Combine constants.py, solution_constants.py, and solution_profiles.py into one file called config.py. This will hold all your noise profiles, solution catalogs, and static mappings.
Why: One file means less jumping around and easier updates.
Pick One Mapping File:
Do This: Keep solution_mapping_new.py since it's more advanced with MongoDB. Delete solution_mapping.py after moving any unique bits over.
Why: Cuts confusion and keeps all mapping logic in one spot.
Streamline Calculator Logic:
Do This: Move the installation logic from solution_calculator.py and acoustic logic from acoustic_calculator.py into the specific solution files (e.g., genieclipceiling.py). Keep cost_calculator.py and blockage_calculator.py separate since they're shared across solutions.
Why: Each solution file will handle its own calculations, making it easier to manage and reducing extra files.
2. Simplify the Frontend
Your frontend has too many small JavaScript files, each doing tiny, specific tasks. Let's consolidate them into fewer, more cohesive modules.

What's Messy
Too Many Manager Files: room-manager.js, wall-manager.js, ceiling-manager.js, and floor-manager.js are all doing similar UI tasks for different surfaces. It's repetitive.
Service Files Overlap: data-service.js and endpoint-service.js both handle API calls but in slightly different ways.
Error Handling Is Split: error-handler.js and error-utils.js divide error logging and UI display, which is unnecessary.
How to Fix It
Merge Surface Managers:
Do This: Create a single surface_ui.js file to handle UI logic for all surfaces (walls, ceilings, floors). Use a parameter to specify the surface type.
Why: Less code to maintain, and it's easier to follow.
Combine API Services:
Do This: Merge endpoint-service.js into data-service.js. Let data-service.js handle all API calls, including caching and cooldowns.
Why: Simplifies API logic and keeps it all in one place.
Unify Error Handling:
Do This: Combine error-handler.js and error-utils.js into error_manager.js for both logging and displaying errors.
Why: One file for errors means less complexity and easier debugging.
3. Fix Error Handling and Validation
Right now, errors are sneaky—they either don't show up or aren't clear, making it hard to figure out what's wrong. Let's make them loud and helpful.

What's Messy
Backend Errors Are Silent: Solution classes (e.g., genieclipceiling.py) return None when something goes wrong without logging or explaining why.
Frontend Lets Bad Data Through: dimensions-input.js and form-handlers.js don't check inputs well, so junk data can break things.
API Errors Are Hidden: data-service.js just logs errors to the console, leaving users clueless.
How to Fix It
Make Backend Errors Talk:
Do This: Instead of returning None, raise specific exceptions (e.g., ValueError for bad inputs) and log them with details (e.g., "Invalid dimensions in GenieClipCeiling").
Why: You'll know exactly what broke and where.
Tighten Frontend Validation:
Do This: In dimensions-input.js, check that inputs are positive numbers and required fields are filled before updating FormState. Use error_manager.js to show messages like "Please enter a positive height."
Why: Stops bad data early and guides users to fix it.
Improve API Error Handling:
Do This: In data-service.js, catch API errors, log them, and use error_manager.js to display user-friendly messages like "Oops, the server's taking a nap. Try again later."
Why: Keeps users informed and the app responsive.
4. Cut Out the Junk Files
Some files are just hanging around, either outdated or redundant. Let's clean house.

Files to Remove or Merge
solution_mapping.py: Old mapping file—move anything useful to solution_mapping_new.py and delete it.
fix-floor-display.js: A quick fix for floor display—add its logic to recommendation-display-manager.js and remove it.
modular-bridge.js: Legacy bridge—once you've simplified, see if it's still needed. If not, trash it.
How to Do It
Do This: For each file, check if it has unique logic. If it does, move that logic to the appropriate main file. Then delete the junk file.
Why: Less clutter, cleaner codebase.
5. Test It All
After making these changes, we gotta make sure everything still works. Test the key parts to catch any slip-ups.

What to Test
Backend Calculations: Run calculations for each solution with both good and bad inputs. Check the logs for proper error messages.
Frontend Inputs: Test entering valid and invalid data in the forms. Make sure errors pop up correctly.
API Calls: Simulate API failures (e.g., disconnect MongoDB) and check if fallbacks and error messages work.
Why This Will Make Your Life Easier
Less Code to Manage: Fewer files and less repetition mean you're not drowning in complexity.
Clearer Errors: Better logging and user feedback make debugging a breeze.
Simpler Structure: Consolidated logic means you know exactly where to look when something needs fixing.
Your Next Steps
Start with the Backend: Merge the static data files into config.py and delete the old ones.
Then Hit the Frontend: Combine the surface managers into surface_ui.js.
Fix Errors as You Go: Update error handling in one file at a time (e.g., start with genieclipceiling.py).
Test After Each Change: Don't wait—test small chunks to catch issues early.
