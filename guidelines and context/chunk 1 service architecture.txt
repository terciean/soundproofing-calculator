Service Architecture Overview

The application uses a layered service architecture with two main services:

1. DataService (data-service.js)
- Provides centralized data access layer
- Handles caching of noise profiles, solution catalog, and mappings
- Uses 5 minute cache TTL for frequently changing data
- Implements fallback data for offline operation

2. EndpointService (endpoint-service.js)
- Manages API communication
- Uses 24 hour cache TTL for relatively static data
- Implements retry logic and cooldown periods
- Provides fallback solutions when API is unavailable

Both services extend BaseService which provides:
- Unified caching implementation (memory + localStorage)
- Standardized error handling and logging
- Service initialization and lifecycle management
- Retry logic for failed requests

Key Improvements:

1. Caching Strategy
- Two-level caching (memory + localStorage)
- Configurable TTL per service
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cache versioning support

2. Error Handling
- Centralized error management
- Fallback data support
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed error logging

3. Service Initialization
- Asynchronous initialization
- Health checks for endpoints
- Event-based status updates
- Dependency management

4. Data Management
- Centralized data access
- Consistent API interfaces
- Type validation
- Data transformation

This architecture provides:
- Improved reliability through caching
- Better error recovery
- Consistent data access patterns
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance
