# Testing & Development Tools Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the testing and development tools used in the application.

## Testing Framework

### Unit Tests
- Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
- Automated test execution and reporting
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end testing of system components
- API endpoint validation
- Database integration testing

### Development Tools

### Performance Monitor (performance-monitor.js)
- Tracks application performance metrics
- Monitors resource usage
- Provides performance alerts

### Logger (logger.js)
- Centralized logging system
- Log level management
- Log persistence and retrieval

### Theme Manager (theme-manager.js)
- Manages application themes
- Handles theme switching
- Persists theme preferences

## Backend Integration
- Tests validate backend functionality
- Performance monitoring tracks system health
- Logging integrates with backend services

## Dependencies
- Tests depend on pytest and unittest
- Development tools are independent
- Monitoring tools integrate with backend

## Usage Examples
```javascript
// Running tests
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/

// Monitoring performance
const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
monitor.trackMetrics();

// Managing themes
const themeManager = new ThemeManager();
themeManager.setTheme('dark');
```

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep tests up to date with code changes
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document test scenarios and requirements
